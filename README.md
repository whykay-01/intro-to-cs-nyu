# Introduction to Computer Science
üòç This is a repo that contains all the content from the introductory CS course at NYU called "Introduction to Computer Science"

I did not create a course, materials of which I am publishing right now. This is what I learned and coded by myself throughout the course. Please do not copy anything from here without the permission.
